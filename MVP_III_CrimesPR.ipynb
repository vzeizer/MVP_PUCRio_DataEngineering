    "### MVP's Title: Crimes's Investigations in Parana over 2018-2023 years\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this work, it is going to be created a **Data Pipeline** in DataBricks using the free service named **DataBricks Community Edition**. Here, a plain Table will be created and the correspondent *ETL* (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is going to be detailed and documented, as shown below. The pipeline was written in PySpark and the *Transformation* part was fully documented in order to get governance over the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The State of Paraná, in Brazil, has experienced significant variations in *crime rates* over the past years. While some municipalities have seen a decline in crime, others have seen an increase. This raises questions about the factors that contribute to crime rates in different areas of the state. By understanding these relationships, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and potential causal factors that could help in developing targeted crime prevention strategies and socioeconomic policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Research Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To what extent do socioeconomic factors, such as the *Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI)* and *Gross Domestic Product (GDP)* per capita, influence crime rates in the State of Paraná, Brazil?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the *most dangerous cities* according to a specific kind of Crime in the State of Paraná?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Impact of Drug-Related Crimes*: How do drug-related crimes (trafficking or use/consumption) relate to other types of crimes? Is there a significant overlap or correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MVP's Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the collected data, the following questions about Crimes in the State of Paraná along the 2018-2023 years will be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the correlation between Crimes, such as Rapes and Thefts, and GDP or MHDI?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the Top 10 cities in State of Paraná with the highest number of Rape Crimes?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the Top 10 cities in State of Paraná with the highest number of Robbery Crimes?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are the Top 10 cities in State of Paraná with the highest number of Drug Trafficking Occurrences?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are the Top 10 cities in State of Paraná with the highest number of Vehicle Thefts?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the Top 10 cities in State of Paraná with the highest Disturbing of Piece/Tranquility?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the mean Drug Trafficking and Drug use Occurrences in Curitiba? \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Concerning the 7-th question, what about specifically in year 2020?"

    "- The data collected is a [**data silo**](https://www.tibco.com/glossary/what-is-a-data-silo), which means that there might be duplicated data, limited data access (this could explain null values), poor data quality (e.g., brutal discrepancies in the values of the same feature for different cities, as well as in the same city for different years, even taking into account population's size) because Features (e.g., *Threat Crimes* or *Rape Crimes*) could have been measured in different scales for different cities. This means that **this dataset lacks a standardization procedure** accross the cities within the State of Paraná, leading to **inconsistencies in the data**, hardening further data interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are summarized several steps and strategies to address and heal data silos:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify and Understand the Silos**\n",
    "Assessment: Identify all data sources and silos within the organization. In the present dataset, there are many inconcistent values of the same feature for a given city and between different cities, even taking population's size into consideration.\n",
    "Analysis: Understand the type of data each silo contains, how it is stored, and who manages it.\n",
    "2. **Establish a Data Governance Framework**\n",
    "Policies and Procedures: Develop and enforce policies for data management, access, and sharing.\n",
    "Roles and Responsibilities: Assign clear roles and responsibilities for data stewardship and management.\n",
    "3. **Centralize Data Storage**\n",
    "Data could be centralized stored in a Data Warehouse or a Data Lake.\n",
    "*Data Warehouse*: Implement a data warehouse to centralize structured data from different silos.\n",
    "*Data Lake*: Use a data lake to centralize unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "4. **Adopt Modern Data Platforms and Technologies**\n",
    "Cloud Solutions: Leverage cloud-based platforms like DataBricks, AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalable and flexible data storage and integration.\n",
    "Data Virtualization: Use data virtualization to create a virtual data layer that integrates data from multiple sources without moving it.\n",
    "5. **Ensure Data Quality and Consistency**\n",
    "Data Cleaning: Regularly clean and standardize data to ensure accuracy and consistency, as well as search for local outliers and inconsistent values.\n",
    "6. **Facilitate Cross-Departmental Collaboration**\n",
    "Communication: Foster a culture of communication and collaboration among departments (in this case, among cities).\n",
    "Shared Objectives: Align data management objectives with overall business goals to ensure all departments work towards a common purpose. In the present study, collect data aiming to understand the relationship between crimes and socieconomic factors.\n",
    "7. **Utilize Data Governance Tools and Platforms**\n",
    "Metadata Management: Use tools to manage metadata and ensure that data is well-documented and easily discoverable.\n",
    "*Data Catalogs*: Implement data catalogs to help users find and understand the data available across the organization (among different cities)."

Therefore, improving the data gathering/collection step would significantly enhance the data analysis and the conclusions/inferences obtained from data analyses;\n",

    "[Q2-Q8] - These questions concerned statistics about different types of Crimes in the State of Paraná. It was noticed that \"big cities\" in population, like *Curitiba* or *São José dos Pinhais* were not present in the top 10 cities concerning a given crime, and this could be related to a lack of standardization of the measurements among different cities. This was confirmed in the investigations performed in the *Data Quality* section, which also pointed out that the data is a *data silos*, meaning that there is, among other things, lack of standardization and communication between different systems in the State of Paraná. Addressing and improving these issues would significantly increase the value obtained from this data, and help battle against Crimes for different cities within the State of Paraná.\n",

    "1. Adding more exogenous variables in the dataset, such as *Population*. However, the data silos presented in this dataset would harden creating features like \"Crimes by 100K Habitants\";\n",
    "2. Creating more insight visualizations and making them publicly available. However, this would imply in costs in the credit card, since a paid service should be used;\n",
    "3. Increasing the granularity of the \"municipality\" of this dataset, by addressing crimes by neighboord in a given city. However, more socieconomic variables/features would be necessary to be collected. Again, the data silos presented here would harden these investigations. Therefore, it is mandatory to address and solve these data silos's issues."
